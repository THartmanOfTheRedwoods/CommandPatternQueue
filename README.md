# Command Design Pattern

This is an implementation of the command design pattern that allows for passing image manipulation requests via JeroMQ. The CommandQueueInvoker is completely decoupled from the command requests being made by the Client. The Receivers are the concrete classes ResizeImage and BorderImage, and of course more image manipulation commands could be added. In this way, the ImageCommands (ResizeImageCommand and BorderImageCommand) encapsulate the client's request by composing themselves with the receiver of the command, and provoding execute and undo methods to allow the Invoker to execute them at a later time without knowing how, or even what, the underlying receiver objects are/work.
